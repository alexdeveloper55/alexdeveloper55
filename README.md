👨‍💻About Me: I am a Full-stack Engineer with proven experience in TypeScript (ES6+), React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Docker and other technologies. Two achievements I am most proud of: leading a team of 3 developers hosting 13PB+ of connected data over 500 servers worldwide and delivering over 25+ features in the Crypto and hospitality space.
🚀Motivated by a continuous obsession to write custom Excel functions and scripts in my early days as a Developer Analyst. I decided to pursue an international career in the software industry.
🧘My Personal Motto: “Conceive with Possibility, Create with Purpose, Craft with Precision.”
🛠️At the moment I work at Yumpingo building fullstack products for the hospitality industry using the stack I love the most, JavaScript. On the side I teach Data Structures & Algorithms to new developers from all backgrounds at the Noisebridge hackerspace in San Francisco.
